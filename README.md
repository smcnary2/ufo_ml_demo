# ufo_ml_demo

## Introduction
this is for the data science club and it meant to be run in kaggle notebooks
this is the link to the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

## Goal
I tried to keep the code relatively simple. The model does not have high accuracy I will show during club meeting how to improve that
